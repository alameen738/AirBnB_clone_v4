"Web Flask" is likely a typo or a misnomer. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it ideal for developing web applications quickly and with minimal code. Flask allows developers to build web applications by providing tools and libraries for routing URLs, handling HTTP requests and responses, rendering templates, and more.

So, when someone mentions "Flask" in the context of web development, they're usually referring to the Flask web framework. It's not typically referred to as "Web Flask."
